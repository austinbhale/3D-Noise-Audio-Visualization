### Performance vs. Quality
##### The default Post-Processing and Color Space settings are set for a high performance by default.
##### The following tips may boost performance, but lower the quality:
* Under Project Settings > Player > Color Space, set the color space to Gamma.
* In the NoiseFlowfield GameObject, limit the number of mesh particles to spawn to a reasonable number.
* Lessen or remove the Bloom setting on the Post-Processing Profile.
